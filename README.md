contacts: An array that holds the list of contacts.
search: A string that holds the value of the search input.
selectedContact: An object that represents the currently selected contact.
useEffect: A hook that allows you to perform side effects in functional components. It is used to load contacts when the component mounts.

FlatList: A component used to render a scrolling list of items efficiently. It is used to display the list of filtered contacts.

TouchableOpacity: A component used to create a pressable area that gives feedback to the user. It is used to handle contact press events.

Modal: A component used to create a modal dialog box. It is used to display additional details of a selected contact.

StyleSheet: An object used to create a stylesheet for styling React Native components. It is used to define the styles for various components in the app.

The loadContacts function is responsible for loading the contacts data into the application. In this code, it is simulating the process of loading contacts from a phone.

Inside the loadContacts function, there is an array called mockContacts that represents the contacts data. Each contact is represented as an object with two properties: name and number.
